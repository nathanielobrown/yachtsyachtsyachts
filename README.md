# yachtsyachtsyachts.com
This is the code for a [yachtsyachtsyachts.com](http://yachtsyachtsyachts.com). From the website: "YachtsYactsYachts.com searches 8
boat listing sites so you only have to search one. It groups boats listed on multiple sites together,
so your results have no duplicates."

## Stack
The backend is Flask+SQLAlchemy+celery while the frontend is Vue.js+pure.css.

## Status
Right now search can only be done via manufacturer/length. This works well for some searches, but not for others. Adding model name and year would be good. Also, integrating eBay results and possibly a few others would be nice. Enhancements welcome!
